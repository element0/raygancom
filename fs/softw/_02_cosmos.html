	  <div><div class="list-item-title">Cosmos</div> is a collection of tools I have been creating over time.  They are designed to fit together.  My own little ecosystem.  They are designed to play nice with others.  I aim for standards compliance.  If you find something in this suite you like, feel free to hack it.  Everything's on Git hub.  Everything is GPL or similarly licensed.  I want you to have as much fun as I did making this.  And that means feeling the power of a compiler under your fingers.</div>
